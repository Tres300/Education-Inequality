# Education-Inequality
## Description
Data Science exploration project to answer the question: Is school performance predicted by socioeconomic factors?

## Data Sources
### EdGap data
EdGap_data.xlsx is the data set containing information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district in the year 2016.

All socioeconomic data (household income, unemployment, adult educational attainment, and family structure) are from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.

[EdGap.org ](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987) report that ACT and SAT score data is from each state’s department of education or some other public data release. The nature of the other public data release is not known.

[EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987) do not indicate that they processed the data in any way. The data were assembled by the [EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987) team. Given the public nature of the data, the original data sources can be consulted to check the quality of the data.

### School information data
ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv is the data set that contains basic information about each school from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp).

This data set consists of basic identifying information about schools and can be assumed to be of reasonably high quality.
